# Ride-Sharing Simulation – Final Project Prep

## Purpose / Design
This project builds the basic structure for a ride-sharing simulator using Python. It includes three classes — Car, Rider, and Simulation — designed with object-oriented principles for clear and reusable code.

## How to Run
1. Make sure all files (`car.py`, `rider.py`, `simulation.py`, and the test script) are in the same folder.
2. Run the test script from your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python test_script.py 
```
## Dependencies
This project requires Python 3 and uses no external libraries.
